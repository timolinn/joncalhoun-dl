## Installation

+ Ensure [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl#installation) is installed and in your PATH.

To install this package run

```sh
$ go get -u github.com/timolinn/joncalhoun-dl
```

### To build from source run

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:timolinn/joncalhoun-dl.git
$ cd joncalhoun-dl
$ go build .
```

## How to use

If you installed via `go get`, you can simply run

```sh
$ joncalhoun-dl -email=jon@doe.com -password=12345 -course=gophercises -output=your-chosen-directory
[joncalhoun-dl]: fetching video urls for gophercises
[joncalhoun-dl]: fetching data from https://courses.calhoun.io/courses/cor_gophercises...
```

If you built from source, the compiled binary should be in the current folder.

```sh
$ ./joncalhoun-dl -email=jon@doe.com -password=12345 -course=gophercises -output=your-chosen-directory[joncalhoun-dl]: fetching video urls for gophercises
[joncalhoun-dl]: fetching data from https://courses.calhoun.io/courses/cor_gophercises...
```

Also note, video downloads **resumes** from where it stopped, so should you experience network interruption nothing to worry about just make sure the output directory remains the same.

### Command [OPTIONS]

+ `--email` [required] : Your account email address. Sign up [here](https://courses.calhoun.io/signup?)
+ `--password` [required]: Your account password. _Unlike the unix password prompt, this will not hide your password by default, you'll have to keep an eye over your shoulder ðŸ˜‰_
+ `--course` [gophercises | algorithmswithgo | testwithgo | webdevwithgo]: This is the name of the course you want to download. **defaults** to `"gophercises"`
+ `--output` [optional]: This is the output directory, which means where you want the videos to be saved. It must be an absolute path. If this is not specified, we will try to create a `"/[course] folder"` (ie. the specified course name eg. `gophercises`) within your current working directory.
+ `--cache` [optional]: Specify your desired location where the cache will be saved. joncalhoun-dl uses the cached data to resume downloads incase of an interruption. It also prevents unecessary repeated calls to the remote server. This will **default** to a `joncalhoun-dl-cache` folder within the output directoy.
+ `--help` [optional]: Prints usage options
